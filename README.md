# Analysis of Testing Methods For PTM-Enabled Open Source Software Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains experiments to analyze testing patterns like unit, integration and E2E tests in open-source software repositories using Pre-Trained machine learning models. The list of repositories analyzed were derived from two datasets - ML Products dataset and the PeaTMOSS dataset. For more details, check out this [report](report.pdf) / [slides](slides.pptx).
